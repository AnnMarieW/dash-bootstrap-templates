### Demo of ThemeSwitchAIO with local stylesheets

This is an example of using local stylesheets in the assets folder in ThemeSwitchAIO.

```python
ThemeSwitchAIO(aio_id="theme", themes=["/assets/theme1.css", "/assets/theme2.css" ])
```

Available in `dash-bootstrap-templates>=V1.0.8`


 Note!! - As of Dash Bootstrap Components V1.5.0, we recommend using the Bootstrap Light Dark Color Modes feature 
 to switch between light and dark versions of a single theme rather than using the ThemeSwitchAIO component.
